config TRUSTONIC_TEE_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable Trustonic TEE Support"
	default n
	---help---
	  Enable Trustonic TEE Support.
	  This option enables MobiCore Driver which is used to communicate with
	  TEE OS, for things like, setting up log buffers, interrupt pins,
	  and IPC channels.

	string "TRUSTONIC TEE Version"
	depends on TRUSTONIC_TEE_SUPPORT
	default "302c" if (ARCH_MT6570 || ARCH_MT6580)

	  Enable Linux Kernel MobiCore Support
	  This option enables MobiCore Driver which is used to communicate with
	  TEE OS, for things like, setting up log buffers, interrupt pins,
	  and IPC channels.

config MOBICORE_DEBUG
	bool "MobiCore Module debug mode"
	depends on MOBICORE_DRIVER
	default n
	---help---
	  Enable Debug mode in the MobiCore Driver.
	  MobiCore Driver has loglevel control thru DEBUG and VERBOSE
	  This option enables MCDRV_DBG() macros to print useful debugging
	  information about mobicore operations.

config MOBICORE_VERBOSE
	bool "MobiCore Module verbose debug mode"
	depends on MOBICORE_DEBUG
	default n
	---help---
	  Enable Verbose Debug mode in the MobiCore Driver.
	  It enables MCDRV_DBG_VERBOSE() macros to print extra information
	  about mobicore operations. Beware: this is only useful for
	  debuging deep in the driver because it prints too much logs

config MOBICORE_API
	tristate "Linux MobiCore API"
	depends on MOBICORE_DRIVER
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable Linux Kernel MobiCore API
	  This option enables MobiCore Driver which is used to communicate with
	  TEE OS, for things like, setting up log buffers, interrupt pins,

config TRUSTONIC_TRUSTED_UI
	tristate "<t-base TUI"
	depends on TRUSTONIC_TEE_SUPPORT
	default n
	---help---
	  Enable <t-base Trusted User Interface
	  Trustonic TUI features was based on Trustonic TEE mechanism to protect
	  Touch/Display inside TEE, to prevent malicious access of sensitive data
	  used by APPs like Banking.
